This repository showcases my practice of Python fundamentals.
The goal is to build a strong programming foundation while maintaining clean, readable, and well-organized code.
My background in UI/UX design influences how I approach code — with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and structure.
This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and improving.

# Python Basics – Learning & Practice

Today I studied and practiced Python fundamentals.

## Topics Covered
- Type casting
- Input and output
- Strings
  - Concatenation
  - Length
  - Escape characters
  - Indexing
  - Slicing
  - Negative indexing
- String functions
  - startswith()
  - capitalize()
  - replace()
  - find()
  - count()
- Multiple inputs using split()
- Data types (tuple, list, dictionary)
- Variables and dynamic typing
- Swapping variables
- Python keywords and identifiers

## Practice done
- Practiced basic input/output programs
- String indexing and slicing examples
- Simple logic-based practice questions

## What I worked on today

- Built a Python script that prints song lyrics in the terminal
- Implemented character-by-character output using timed delays
- Practiced loops, timing control, and terminal output behavior

This project helped me better understand how Python controls execution flow in a terminal environment.

#Todays practice

I learnt loops and datatypes and also practiced a lot of example questions and i'll keep on improving my knowledge day by day.
Today I studied loops in Python and practiced using:
- for loops
- while loops
- range() function
- Loop control statements: break, continue, pass

#What I practiced

- Iterating over lists and strings
- Printing patterns using loops
- Using loops with conditions
- Avoiding infinite loops

#What I understood better

- When to use for vs while
- How iteration works step by step
- How to control loop flow using break and continue
