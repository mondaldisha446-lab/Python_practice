#Python_project
Today I,
Worked on a small Python terminal project where song lyrics are printed with timed delays, creating a typing effect.
Through this, I got hands-on practice with Python loops, timing, and terminal output behavior.

#Python_code
import time
import sys

def print_lyrics():
    lyrics = [
        "Jaane Na Tu",
        "Ke Tera Kitna Khayal Main Karun",
        "Ishq Mein Hoon",
        "To Phir Itne Sawal Kyu Karoon",
        "",
        "Chedkhaniyaan Haan Haan",
        "Nazrein Teri Karti Yahaan",
        "Ittar Sa Tu Haan Haan",
        "Mujhme Hi Phir Ghul Sa Gaya",
        "Aaja Maahi Aaja Maahi",
        "",
        "Aaja Maahi Aaja Maahi"
    ]

    delays = [
        0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
        0.3,
        0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.7,
        0.3,3, 1
    ]

    print(" Song Lyrics \n")
    time.sleep(0.9)

    for i, line in enumerate(lyrics):
        for char in line:
            sys.stdout.write(char)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            time.sleep(0.11)
        print()
        time.sleep(delays[i])

print_lyrics()
